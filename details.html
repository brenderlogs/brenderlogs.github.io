<h3>Random Forest Classifier in Python</h3>
<p><a href = "https://github.com/brenderlogs/random_forester">This program</a> can be used to do statistical classification of quantitative data. If you've heard about random forests and want to see what the guts of a random forest look like without any unnecessary overhead, the code should be instructive.</p>

<h3>Tarski's Undefinability Theorem</h3>
<p>Tarski's theorem on the undefinability of the set of true statements of arithmetic in first-order logic is a result that has, in popular mathematics literature, been almost completely eclipsed by G&ouml;del's first incompleteness theorem. This is unfortunate, because a complete exposition of the first incompleteness theorem requires so much more overhead. Tarski's undefinability theorem is no less profound and includes a similar coding trick, as well as the same diagonal argument used in the proof the the first incompleteness theorem; however, assuming some experience with first-order logic, it only takes a few pages to get through the proof of Tarski's theorem. </p> 

<p>If you're interested in reading about it, you can find my exposition <a href = "./files/Tarski.pdf">here</a>.

<h3>Interactive z-Table</h3>
<p><a href = "interactiveztable.html">This</a> is a visual version of the z-table, written in javascript. Click the red dots on the horizontal axis to pick your favourite interval. In its current form, it runs very slowly in firefox for some reason.</p>

<h3>Category Theory Notes</h3>
<p>A few years ago I ran an informal summer course introducing graduate students in computer science to category theory. I made a set of notes complete with exercises, and now they're just sitting in a desk. I started TeXing these, but that project is currently on hold. The Barr & Wells book <a href = "ftp://ftp.math.mcgill.ca/barr/pdffiles/ctcs.pdf">Category Theory for Computing Science</a> is now freely available, and I highly recommend it.</p>
<p>If you happen to be seeking some online category theory literature, you might want to take a look at <a href = "http://www.cs.le.ac.uk/people/akurz/books.html">this section</a> of <a href = "http://www.cs.le.ac.uk/people/akurz/">Alexander Kurz's webpage</a>.

<h3>Thesis</h3>
<p>My <a href = "files/CanonicalModelsOfCoalgebraicAutomata.pdf">master's thesis</a> is concerned with coalgebraic modal logic. The idea is to realize a certain class of structures as the class of coalgebras for an endofunctor, and from that functor extract an adequate and expressive modal logic for reasoning about said structures, along with a complete system of inference. In my thesis I do this explicitly for deterministic Kripe machines. The ultimate goal is to find a uniform way of doing this for as many classes of structures as possible. A few of the most influential people involved in this program are <a href = "http://homepages.cwi.nl/~janr/">Jan Rutten</a>, <a href = "http://www.cs.le.ac.uk/people/akurz/">Alexander Kurz</a>, and <a href = "http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~dirk/">Dirk Pattinson</a>.

<h3>Older Papers</h3>
<p><a href = "files/Approx_Paper.pdf">On the existence of regular approximations</a> is a paper I co-authored with <a href = "http://research.cs.queensu.ca/~ksalomaa/">Kai Salomaa</a> and presented at <a href = "http://www.cs.nmsu.edu/dcfs06/">DCFS 2006</a>. In the paper we introduce an asymptotic measure of how close a given formal language is to being a regular language, and explore properties of this measure.
