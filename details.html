<h3>Statistics in Python</h3>
<p><a href = "https://github.com/brenderlogs/random_forester">This random forest classifier</a> can be used to do classification of quantitative data. Use it to make predictions about anything. I decided to write everything from scratch to learn about python, so no scientific or statistical packages are required.</p>

<p><a href = "https://github.com/brenderlogs/bayesian_coin_thing">This visualization of Bayesian updating</a> is a demonstration of the basic ideas of bayesian statistics. Choose some points to define a polynomial prior distribution for the bias of a coin. Flip the coin any number of times, record the results, and you'll see how the distribution changes with each flip.</p>

<h3>Tarski's Theorem &amp; The Fixed Point Lemma</h3>
<p>Tarski's theorem on the undefinability of arithmetic truth has been almost completely eclipsed by G&ouml;del's first incompleteness theorem in the canon of mathematical logic. This is unfortunate, because a complete exposition of the first incompleteness theorem requires so much more overhead. Tarski's undefinability theorem is no less profound, provides a nice introduction to G&ouml;del numbering and diagonalization, and assuming some experience with first-order logic, it only takes a few pages to develop. You can <a href = "./files/Tarski.pdf">see my exposition here</a>.</p>

<p>The fixed-point lemma is a result that's used to to construct G&ouml;del sentences. One nice way to understand the proof is through a puzzle presented by Raymond Smullyan in <a href = "http://www.amazon.com/Satan-Cantor-Infinity-Mind-Boggling-Puzzles/dp/0679406883">one of his recreational math books</a>. I've written up <a href = "./files/FPL.pdf">this article</a> which presents a rigorous proof based on that puzzle.</p>

<h3>Interactive z-Table and t-Table</h3>
<p>I wrote a visual version of the <a href = "interactiveztable.html">z-table</a> and <a href = "interactivettable.html">t-table</a>  in javascript. Click and drag the red dots on the horizontal axis to pick your favourite interval. In its current form, it runs slowly in firefox for some reason, but everything is smooth in chrome and IE.</p>

<h3>Category Theory Notes</h3>
<p>A few years ago I ran an informal summer course introducing graduate students in computer science to category theory. I made a set of notes complete with exercises, and now they're just sitting in a desk. I started TeXing these, but that project is currently on hold. The Barr &amp; Wells book <a href = "http://www.math.mcgill.ca/triples/Barr-Wells-ctcs.pdf">Category Theory for Computing Science</a> is now freely available, and I highly recommend it.</p>
<p>If you happen to be seeking some online category theory literature, you might want to take a look at <a href = "http://www.cs.le.ac.uk/people/akurz/books.html">this section</a> of <a href = "http://www.cs.le.ac.uk/people/akurz/">Alexander Kurz's webpage</a>.

<h3>Thesis</h3>
<p>My <a href = "files/CanonicalModelsOfCoalgebraicAutomata.pdf">master's thesis</a> was concerned with coalgebraic modal logic. The idea is to realize a certain class of structures as the class of coalgebras for an endofunctor, and from that functor extract an adequate and expressive modal logic for reasoning about said structures, along with a complete system of inference. In my thesis I do this explicitly for deterministic Kripe machines. The ultimate goal is to find a uniform way of doing this for as many classes of structures as possible. A few of the most influential people involved in this program are <a href = "http://homepages.cwi.nl/~janr/">Jan Rutten</a>, <a href = "http://www.cs.le.ac.uk/people/akurz/">Alexander Kurz</a>, and <a href = "http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~dirk/">Dirk Pattinson</a>.

<h3>Older Papers</h3>
<p><a href = "files/Approx_Paper.pdf">On the existence of regular approximations</a> is a paper I co-authored with <a href = "http://research.cs.queensu.ca/~ksalomaa/">Kai Salomaa</a> and presented at <a href = "http://www.cs.nmsu.edu/dcfs06/">DCFS 2006</a>. In the paper we define a measure of how close a given formal language is to being a regular language, and explore properties of this measure.
